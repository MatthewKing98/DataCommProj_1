# DataCommProj_1
You are to complete the implementation and ensure proper functionality. The places where you need to fill in code are marked with #TODO. Each place may require one or more lines of code. 

Note: You are not mandated to use the implementation code provided and can write your own proxy server and server from scratch as needed.

What to Hand in

All code must be turned in through a version control system (e.g github). Provide a link to your repository in classroom/blackboard.
